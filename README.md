In this project we developed a full-stack, single-page appliction using Node.js, HTML, javascript and CSS. The goal was to develop a platform to play connect4 online.
The page was required to possess:
<ul>
  <li> A game logo </li>
  <li> A "settings" menu, where you can change the dimensions of the board, chose a humam opponent or an AI, set AI difficulty and choose the first player to start </li>
  <li> An authentication/register page </li>
  <li> An "instructions" menu </li>
  <li> A "Ranking" menu, with the results of the best players registered </li>
  <li> Communiction with the user in the form of messages (ex: game ended with player x victory; this move is not possible; it's the opponents turn, etc </li>
</ul>

Since the server that was configured was hosted by the university, as is now offline, I provided also an offline version in this repository that allows for local multiplayer as well as all of the functionality of the single-player mode.
